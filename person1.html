        <center><h2>Notes From Interview with Braden</h2></center>
        <ul>
            <li>Braden valued ease of use and reliability in his fire extinguishers</li>
            <li>Braden had not used a fire extinguisher before and thought that at first glance the device seemed complex</li>
            <li>After looking at it further he thought that it seemed rather intuitive, but noted that he was not sure if this same train of thought would follow in the context of a fire</li>
            <li>Braden said that he would not have read the manual in the case of a fire</li>
            <li>Braden noted that the grip marks on the bottom clamp insinuated that fingers were meant to be placed there</li>
            <li>Braden had not noticed the PSI meter and thought that it should be made significantly more obvious as the entire device was not usable if PSI was not accurate</li>
            <li>Braden would simplify design, brighten the color of the device and make the PSI meter more apparent</li>
        </ul>
