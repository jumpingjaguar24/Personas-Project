        <center><h2>Notes From Interview with Hannah</h2></center>

            <li> Hannah valued accessibility of use in her fire extinguisher - specifically that it was easy to know how to use.</li>
            <li>Hannah had not used a fire extinguisher before, she felt intimidated by the look of the fire extinguisher.</li>
            <li>Hannah found the instruction manual on the extinguisher useful. She said that in the case that there was a fire she would read because otherwise she wouldnâ€™t have known what to do.</li>
            <li>She also said that she thought the manual should be even easier to read.</li>
            <li>Hannah instinctively grabbed the clamp of the fire extinguisher and the hose because she said that the fact that those parts had movement (were mobile) indicated to her that they were meant to be manipulated by her.</li>
            <li>Thought that a simplification of the design would be best fitting.</li>
            <li>Did not notice the PSI meter and thought that it should be made more obvious.</li>
            <li>Hannah noted that the PSI meter would need to be checked far in advance in order for it to be useful and that should be made obvious</li>
        </ul>
