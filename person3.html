        <center><h2>Notes From Interview with Maxine</h2></center>

        <ul>
            <li>Maxine valued ease of use and access in a fire extinguisher</li>
            <li>She thought the the clamp on top of the fire extinguisher was intuitive because it presented a ‘squeeze like motion’ that she had been confronted with in other interfaces</li>
            <li>Maxine would not have read the manual because she said that her state of panic would be overwhelming</li>
            <li>She noted that the fire extinguisher was extremely heavy and thought this was an inaccessible design</li>
            <li>Maxine thought this extinguisher did have very good usability</li>
            <li>Braden had not noticed the PSI meter and thought that it should be made significantly more obvious as the entire device was not usable if PSI was not accurate</li>
            <li>Thought that the pin could be removed as precaution measure because it only made the design more complex</li>
            <li>Additionally the various tags and other accompanying accessories could be removed to simplify the design</li>
        </ul>
